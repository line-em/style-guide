# Style Guide

Style Guide built at CodeAcademy's Front End Engineer course. ðŸŽ‰

## Changelog

- 1.0 - Initial commit.
- 1.1 - Added interactivity in the code. I received a lovely feedback on the [CodeAcademy forums](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/build-a-website-style-guide-challenge-project-html-css/462395/448), which I will try to fully implement later!

## To-do

- [ ] Add interactivity to the Typography section: change the quotes?
